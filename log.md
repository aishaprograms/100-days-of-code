# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a basic random quote app using Foundation CSS and vanilla Javascript.

**Thoughts:**: I was excited yet nervous to try using a new CSS framework i.e. one that I've never used before. It was as straightforward as Bootstrap and Materialize CSS. It was also satisfying to work through the challenge of retrieving data from the API using XMLHttpRequest instead of jQuery AJAX method.

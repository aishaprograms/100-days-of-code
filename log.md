# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a basic random quote app using Foundation CSS and vanilla Javascript.

**Thoughts:**: I was excited yet nervous to try using a new CSS framework i.e. one that I've never used before. It was as straightforward as Bootstrap and Materialize CSS. It was also satisfying to work through the challenge of retrieving data from the API using XMLHttpRequest instead of jQuery AJAX method.

## Day 2: January 5, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I completed the basic random quote app using Foundation CSS, vanilla Javascript, and Andrux Random Famous Quote API.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with the CSS trick to vertically center the page content, but found the right solution that would vertically center any element. I could do more with this web app. However, I'm going to move onto different projects and return to this one once I have some inspiration.

## Day 3: January 6, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Started working with HTML5 canvas. Didn't get far in coding as I spent most of my time learning the ropes.

**Thoughts:** I look forward to coding something different from anything I've coded before.

## Day 4: January 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I started on a project which integrates Node and SQL. I switched over to this since it directly relates to what we are learning in class.

**Thoughts:** SQL can get tricky!

## Day 5: January 8, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I completed half of the work which involves inquirer. After adding the mysql methods, it will add the inquirer answers to the database.

From January 9, 2017 to January 11, 2017 were sick days. January 10 pushes were homework.

## Day 6: January 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Project completed. Simulates a bidding app.

**Thoughts:** After a few sick days, it felt good to complete a project.

## Day 7: January 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Started on a local weather app. Uses HTML5 geolocation. Logs weather to console.

**Thoughts:** I'm still wrapping my mind around using callbacks in async functions.

## Day 8: January 14, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continued weather app. Has a pretty UI now.

**Thoughts:** The app is slow. I need to figure this out tomorrow. It might be a combo of HTML5 gelocation retrieval and AJAX JSON data retrieval.

## Day 9: January 15, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I added weather icons to my Local Weather app which picks an appropriate icon based on the weather description.

**Thoughts:** I practiced using a switch case. It's still not so intuitive for me yet, but I learn more as I practice.

## Day 10: January 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I added both Celsius and Fahrenheit to the app and made some CSS changes.

**Thoughts:** My code seems very readable and almost semantic. I'm trying to write clearer code.

## Day 11: January 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I started reading up on Dark Sky API and other web app deployment sites. I'm going to modify the code for my app tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** It's good to try different APIs because I can compare and contrast what the have to offer.

## Day 12: January 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I was curious about the importance of private API keys so I read up on APIs and backend development. Since I just started learning about backend development at school, I spent time going through an Express JS tutorial. I might just make my local weather app a full stack app.

## Day 13: January 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I changed the code to retrieve the location using ip address. I did this because geolocation is allowed only over HTTPS. I'm still struggling to work with OpenWeatherMap api since it uses an HTTP url in the free version.

**Thoughts:** Why do I have to pay for HTTPS connection to OpenWeatherMap api? Grr.

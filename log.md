# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I made a basic random quote app using Foundation CSS and vanilla Javascript.

**Thoughts:**: I was excited yet nervous to try using a new CSS framework i.e. one that I've never used before. It was as straightforward as Bootstrap and Materialize CSS. It was also satisfying to work through the challenge of retrieving data from the API using XMLHttpRequest instead of jQuery AJAX method.

## Day 2: January 5, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I completed the basic random quote app using Foundation CSS, vanilla Javascript, and Andrux Random Famous Quote API.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with the CSS trick to vertically center the page content, but found the right solution that would vertically center any element. I could do more with this web app. However, I'm going to move onto different projects and return to this one once I have some inspiration.

## Day 3: January 6, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Started working with HTML5 canvas. Didn't get far in coding as I spent most of my time learning the ropes.

**Thoughts:** I look forward to coding something different from anything I've coded before.

## Day 4: January 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I started on a project which integrates Node and SQL. I switched over to this since it directly relates to what we are learning in class.

**Thoughts:** SQL can get tricky!
